---

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone Repository (or download the ZIP)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EliasPython/MCS---Minecraft-Scanner.git
cd MCS---Minecraft-Scanner
```



### 2. Install Dependencies (or on Windows run the setup.bat file)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Required Packages:**
- `aiohttp` - Asynchronous HTTP requests
- `colorama` - Colored console output

Or simply:
```bash
pip install aiohttp colorama
```

### 3. Adjust Configuration

Edit `config/config.py`:

```python
WEBHOOK_URL = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL"
PORT = 25565              # Standard Minecraft Port
TIMEOUT = 3               # Timeout in seconds
CONCURRENCY = 500         # Simultaneous connections
WEB_HOST = "0.0.0.0"      # Webserver host (for Multi-Instance)
WEB_PORT = 8080           # Webserver port (for Multi-Instance)
```

---

## 🎮 Usage

### Standard Mode (with GUI)

```bash
python scanner_v2GUI.py
```

The scanner starts with the cyberpunk GUI and begins scanning immediately.

### Multi-Run Mode

In the **CONNECT** field at the top right, you can enter:
- `run 2` to `run 10` - Runs 2-10 scan passes sequentially

Example:
```
run 5
```
Runs 5 passes with 1000 IPs each.

### Multi-Instance Mode

#### Start Master (first instance):
```bash
python scanner_v2GUI.py
```
The first instance automatically becomes the Master.

#### Start Workers (additional instances):
Simply start `scanner_v2GUI.py` in new terminal windows:
```bash
python scanner_v2GUI.py  # Instance 2 - automatically becomes Worker
python scanner_v2GUI.py  # Instance 3 - automatically becomes Worker
```

**Features in Multi-Instance Mode:**
- Automatic Master/Worker detection
- Statistics are aggregated and displayed in the Master
- No duplicate webhook notifications
- Workers can be started/stopped at any time

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Settings in the GUI

Under the **⚙️ SETTINGS** tab, you can adjust the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `WEBHOOK_URL` | Discord Webhook URL | - |
| `PORT` | Minecraft Server Port | 25565 |
| `TIMEOUT` | Connection timeout (seconds) | 3 |
| `CONCURRENCY` | Simultaneous connections | 500 |
| `WEB_HOST` | Webserver host | 0.0.0.0 |
| `WEB_PORT` | Webserver port | 8080 |

**Note:** A restart is required after saving settings.

### Advanced Configuration

Additional parameters can be set in `config/config.py`:

```python
# Probability for ASN-based IPs (0.0 - 1.0)
ASN_PROB = 0.5

# CIDR expansion for ASN ranges (0-8)
ASN_EXPAND_BITS = 4

# Title update limits
TITLE_MIN_SECONDS = 0.5
TITLE_SCAN_STEP = 10
```

## 📊 Statistics Explained

### Main Statistics (Scanner Tab)
- **Scanned** - Number of scanned IPs
- **Found** - Number of found Minecraft servers
- **With Players** - Servers with at least 1 player
- **Server scanner per hour** - Estimated scan rate per hour
- **Webhooks Sent** - Number of sent Discord notifications
- **Active Scanners** - Number of active scanner instances
- **Run Progress** - Progress in Multi-Run mode

### Advanced Statistics (Advanced Tab)
- **Scans/Min** - Average scans per minute
- **Found/Min** - Average found servers per minute
- **Current Rate** - Current scan rate (scans/second)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Scanning Algorithm
1. **IP Generation** - Random IPs from ASN ranges or completely random
2. **Minecraft Handshake** - Establish protocol-compliant connection
3. **Status Query** - Retrieve server information
4. **Processing** - Parse and display data
5. **Webhook** - Notify Discord when servers are found

### ASN Ranges
The scanner uses IP ranges from major hosting providers:
- **Hetzner** (Germany)
- **OVH** (Europe & USA)
- **DigitalOcean**
- **Contabo**
- **Netcup**
- **AWS, Azure, Google Cloud**
- **Linode, Vultr**
- **And many more...**

### Performance Optimizations
- **ThreadPoolExecutor** for CPU-intensive tasks
- **AsyncIO Semaphore** for controlled concurrency
- **Connection Pooling** for HTTP sessions
- **Efficient Data Structures** (deque, sets)
- **Thread-safe Counters** with locks

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### GUI doesn't start
```bash
# Check if tkinter is installed
python -c "import tkinter; print(tkinter.Tcl().eval('info patchlevel'))"
```

### Webhook doesn't work
- Check the webhook URL in `config/config.py`
- Make sure the URL starts with `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/`
- Check the console for error messages

### Too few servers found
- Increase `CONCURRENCY` in the configuration
- Decrease `TIMEOUT` for faster scanning
- Make sure your internet connection is stable

### Multi-Instance doesn't work
- Make sure `WEB_PORT` (default: 8080) is not blocked
- Check firewall settings
- Each instance must run on the same host (or have network connectivity)
